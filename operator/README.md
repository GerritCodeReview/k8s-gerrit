# Gerrit Operator

## Build

To build all components of the operator run:

```sh
# With E2E tests
mvn clean install
# Without E2E tests
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

## Publish

To publish the container image of the Gerrit Operator run:

```sh
mvn clean install -P publish
```

## Tests

Executing the E2E tests has a few infrastructure requirements that have to be
provided:

- An (unused) Kubernetes cluster
- The 'default' StorageClass that supports ReadWriteOnce access. It has to be
  possible to provision volumes using this StorageClass.
- A StorageClass that supports ReadWriteMany access. It has to be possible to
  provision volumes using this StorageClass. Such a StorageClass could be provided
  by the [NFS-subdir-provisioner chart](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner).
- An [Nginx Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx)
- An installation of [OpenLDAP](../supplements/test-cluster/ldap/openldap.yaml)
  with at least one user.
- Istio installed with the [profile](../istio/gerrit.profile.yaml) provided by
  this project
- A secret containing valid certificates for the given hostnames. For istio this
  secret has to be named `tls-secret` and be present in the `istio-system` namespace.
  For the Ingress controller, the secret has to be either set as the default
  secret to be used or somehow automatically be provided in the namespaces created
  by the tests and named `tls-secret`, e.g. by using Gardener to manage DNS and
  certificates.

A sample setup for components required in the cluster is provided under
`$REPO_ROOT/supplements/test-cluster`. Some configuration has to be done manually
(marked by `#TODO`) and the `deploy.sh`-script can be used to install/update all
components.

In addition, some properties have to be set to configure the tests:

- `rwmStorageClass`: Name of the StorageClass providing RWM-access (default:nfs-client)
- `registry`: Registry to pull container images from
- `RegistryOrg`: Organization of the container images
- `tag`: Container tag
- `registryUser`: User for the container registry
- `registryPwd`: Password for the container registry
- `ingressDomain`: Domain to be used for the ingress
- `istioDomain`: Domain to be used for istio
- `ldapAdminPwd`: Admin password for LDAP server
- `gerritUser`: Username of a user in LDAP
- `gerritPwd`: The password of `gerritUser`

The properties should be set in the `test.properties` file. Alternatively, a
path of a properties file can be configured by using
`mvn clean install -Dproperties=<path to properties file> $TARGET`

## Deploy

First all CustomResourceDefinitions have to be deployed:

```sh
kubectl apply -f target/classes/META-INF/fabric8/*-v1.yml
```

Note that these do not include the -v1beta1.yaml files, as those are for old
Kubernetes versions.

The operator requires a Java Keystore with a keypair inside to allow TLS
verification for Kubernetes Admission Webhooks. To create a keystore and
encode it with base64, run:

```sh
keytool \
  -genkeypair \
  -alias operator \
  -keystore keystore \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -keysize 2048 \
  -validity 3650
cat keystore | base64 -b 0
```

Add the result to the Secret in `k8s/operator.yaml` (see comments in the file)
and also add the base64-encoded password for the keystore to the secret.

Then the operator and associated RBAC rules can be deployed:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/operator.yaml
```

`k8s/operator.yaml` contains a basic deployment of the operator. Resources,
docker image name etc. might have to be adapted.

## Install custom resources

### GerritCluster

The GerritCluster custom resource configures and provisions resources shared by
multiple components in a Gerrit cluster. A cluster is meant to be run in a single
namespace and only one cluster per namespace is allowed.

An example CustomResource is provided at `k8s/cluster.sample.yaml`. To install
it into the cluster run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/cluster.sample.yaml
```

### Gerrit

**NOTE:** A primary Gerrit should never be installed in the same GerritCluster as a
Receiver to avoid conflicts when writing into repositories.

An example of a Gerrit-CustomResource can be found at `k8s/gerrit.sample.yaml`.
To install it into the cluster run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/gerrit.sample.yaml
```

The operator will create all resources to run a primary Gerrit.

### GitGarbageCollection

An example of a GitGc-CustomResource can be found at `k8s/gitgc.sample.yaml`.
To install it into the cluster run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/gitgc.sample.yaml
```

The operator will create a CronJob based on the provided spec.

### Receiver

**NOTE:** A Receiver should never be installed in the same GerritCluster as a
primary Gerrit to avoid conflicts when writing into repositories.

An example of a Receiver-CustomResource can be found at `k8s/receiver.sample.yaml`.
To install it into the cluster run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f k8s/receiver.sample.yaml
```

The operator will create all resources to run a receiver for push replication
requests.

#### Prohibited options in gerrit.config

Some options in the gerrit.config are not allowed to be changed. Their values
are preset by the containers/Kubernetes. The operator will configure those options
automatically and won't allow different values, i.e. it will fail to reconcile
if a value is set to an illegal value. These options are:

- `cache.directory`

    This should stay in the volume mounted to contain the Gerrit site and will
    thus be set to `cache`.

- `container.javaHome`

    This has to be set to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`, since this is
    the path of the Java installation in the container.

- `container.javaOptions = -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore`

    The keystore will be mounted to `/var/gerrit/etc/keystore`.

- `container.replica`

    This has to be set in the Gerrit-CustomResource under `spec.isReplica`.

- `container.user`

    The technical user in the Gerrit container is called `gerrit`.

- `gerrit.basePath`

    The git repositories are mounted to `/var/gerrit/git` in the container.

- `gerrit.canonicalWebUrl`

    The canonical web URL has to be set to the hostname used by the Ingress/Istio.

- `httpd.listenURL`

    This has to be set to `proxy-http://*:8080/` or `proxy-https://*:8080`,
    depending of TLS is enabled in the Ingress or not, otherwise the Jetty
    servlet will run into an endless redirect loop.

- `sshd.advertisedAddress`

    This is only enforced, if Istio is enabled. It can be configured otherwise.

- `sshd.listenAddress`

    Since the container port for SSH is fixed, this will be set automatically.
    If no SSH port is configured in the service, the SSHD is disabled.
