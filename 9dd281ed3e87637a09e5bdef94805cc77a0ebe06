      "message": "This functionality is currently already present in the `publish` script using the `--registry` option. I think it makes sense to already add it here, especially since it reflects the behaviour of `docker build` and `docker push` more closely. However, I would prefer to use the same option name in both cases. Terminology-wise, the server is called registry [1], while a docker repository contains all the versions of a single image, e.g. hub.docker.io/k8sgerrit/gerrit. Thus, the option should be called `--registry` (adding a shorter alias, is of course a welcome change).\n\n[1] https://docs.docker.com/registry/",
