Init-containers as part of the Operator deployments can be used to create a default instance of those CRs and then the Operator manages their lifecycle.\n\nProbably not worth creating a configuration CRD just for one configuration option currently (\"INGRESS\"), but just putting this thought out there in case there happen to be more operator-level configurations in the future.",
