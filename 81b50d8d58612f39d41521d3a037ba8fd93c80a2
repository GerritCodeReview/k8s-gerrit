Exceptions were raised when the `istio envoy proxies` were provisioned in the gerrit instances.\n\nLet us give it another try.",

Using a cookie (current option) has some disadvantages and I am not sure whether we don\u0027t have to use a more stable algorithm (that on the other hand might cause larger imbalances). So having both options available independently might make sense.\nOr if you have some experience with what algorithm works well and if using the host IP is just much better, why not make it the only choice.",
