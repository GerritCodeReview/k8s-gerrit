      "message": "Due to the deprecaation of reviewdb some changes are needed to use \u003e 3.0. I already did the preliminary changes for the gerrit-master chart here in change 223981. But it does not work yet for the gerrit-slave chart. Since this docker image is used as the base for both, I did not update the default yet.\nHowever, I am currently working on the slave (probably by removing the reviewdb functionality entirely) and will upload the respective changes today.",
