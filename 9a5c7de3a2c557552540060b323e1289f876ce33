      "message": "Since I haven\u0027t used the setup outside of some very small artificial test setups back when it was implemented, I can honestly not really tell. I know that it does not have all the features the HA setup has, like CronJobs for Git GC. However, depending on your setup you might not need it, e.g. if you run jgit gc via Gerrit.\nBut concerning other protential issues in larger production setups I can\u0027t tell. However, I know what we faced when first first taking the HA setup live, so without having the experience myself I don\u0027t feel comfortable saying it is production ready. Since Luca is the project lead on MULTISITE however, he might be the better informed person here.",
