      "message": "We just got our k8s-based repacking implementation deployed internally which uses [1] to safely scale repacking to multiple pods. It\u0027s still tied to our internal repack script, but we have plans to split Qualcomm-specific bits out (just a lower priority than our 3.X upgrade related work).\n\nI\u0027m excited to check out what you\u0027re doing here (and learn about k8s operators more)!\n\nAssuming this scales to multiple pods, would you want something like [1] to safely lock against multiple GCs running at the same time for the same repo or are you solving that another way? (apologies that I haven\u0027t read through this change yet, so maybe it\u0027s answered already)\n\n[1] https://github.com/quic/lockers",
