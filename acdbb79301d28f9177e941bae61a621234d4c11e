      "message": "Is why only the git-gc section was having issues with the nodeAffinity? Why is the indent the same for tolerations, nodeSelector, and affinity in other templates (i.e. https://gerrit.googlesource.com/k8s-gerrit/+/refs/heads/master/helm-charts/gerrit-replica/templates/gerrit-replica.stateful-set.yaml#47 - all are on the same indent level) but here the tolerations nindent is 10 while the nodeSelector and affinity will be 12?",

      "message": "Yes, this is the reason.\n`tolerations` are a list, while `affinity` and `nodeSelector` are maps. Lists can start at the same indent level as the parent, i.e. the `-` is at the same level. This is the style that we are actually using in yaml. Thus, I kept it as is although one indent level more would also work.",
