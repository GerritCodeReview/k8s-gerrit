      "message": "This implies that `gerrit-maintenance.py` is used to perform git gc. However the documentation in the `README.md` says that actually many subcommands are (or will be) provided:\n```\nUse `/var/tools/gerrit-maintenance.py` to start the CLI. Dependent on the\n  subcommand different tasks may be performed.\n```\n\nMaybe I just do not understand the design but this seems like a global option of the `gerrit-maintenance` tool? There will be (sub)commands which do not require `-p` option?",
