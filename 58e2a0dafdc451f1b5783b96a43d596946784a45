Thus, so far we were using just the `export LANG` below. I don\u0027t know, if we even use mod_dav. Since this file was created by just installing Apache2 on Ubuntu, this were just the defaults.\n\nIf there were no issues so far for the docker-based setup, I wouldn\u0027t think we need to change that.",
