      "message": "@thomas.draebing@sap.com Regarding your comment [1]. We have tried to follow the pattern defined currently in the class but all the checks were executed even when the cluster mode is `MULTISIDE` and that is not correct. In order to avoid that we introduced this temporal guard to check if the cluster mode is `MULTISITE`. Eventually in the next iteration this code will be removed because a new GerritCluster/Gerrit CR webhook validations will be introduced for the cluster mode is `MULTISITE` making the code cleaner and with single responsibility.\n\nReferences: \n[1] https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/c/k8s-gerrit/+/425208/15..19/operator/src/main/java/com/google/gerrit/k8s/operator/admission/servlet/GerritClusterAdmissionWebhook.java#b57",
