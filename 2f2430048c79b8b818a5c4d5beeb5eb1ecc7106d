We could also run it\nbefore the line 70 and have the same side effect: the already installed plugins which are\nnot wanted will be deleted.\n\nThis code is actually a side-effect: we call a boolean method (needs_init) which should\ndetermine if an init is needed or not, but it does more than that: it also removed some\nplugins jar files. Such side-effects are not considered a good practice is programming.\nI would suggest to keep this method clean and side-effect free. If an init is needed\nyou can cleanup already installed plugins which are not wanted in an explicit step\njust before calling the init program.",
