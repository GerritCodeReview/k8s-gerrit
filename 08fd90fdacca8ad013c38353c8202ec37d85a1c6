      "message": "This solution to have the same logger configuration without code duplication over all scripts is not very elegant. I suggest to restructure the python scripts into a single package. So that only one main script is called, giving it the command to execute.\n\ne.g.: gerrit-init initialize -s /var/gerrit\n\nThat would be a far better structure and would also allow us to build a binary, which may require far less space in the container image.\n\nI will try that in a future change.",
