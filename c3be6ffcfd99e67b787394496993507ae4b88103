      "message": "It\u0027s important to note that we encountered an issue with `Session affinity based on source IP` when deploying a `multisite` installation in `GKE` using the `Istio default profile`. We observed that the source IP was lost after the traffic passed through the ingress gateways, resulting in traffic from the same user being distributed across all pods.\n\nAfter researching, we found a solution documented at https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/security/authorization/authz-ingress/. We applied a patch to the `istio-ingressgateway` service using the following command:\n```\nkubectl patch svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system -p \u0027{\"spec\":{\"externalTrafficPolicy\":\"Local\"}}\u0027\n```\nThis resolved the issue, ensuring that traffic from the same user consistently reached the same pod. However, I acknowledge that my understanding of Istio is limited, and I need to delve deeper into it for further investigation.",
