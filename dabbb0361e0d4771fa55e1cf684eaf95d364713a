      "message": "Should those labels also be applied to the StatefulSet and/or used by the LabelSelector as well?\nIf not, I think it would be more descriptive to use `additionalPodLabels` as the key.\nAlso to keep the number of options as small as possible, would you require different labels for pods created by different Deployments/StatefulSets etc.? Or would a top level option and adding those labels to all resources managed by the charts also be an option?",
