      "message": "It has also bothered me a bit, that we use a quite opinionated configuration here (which is based on our experiences at SAP and Shawn\u0027s original script this is based on).\nI would suggest the following: We remove the part setting configuration entirely from the GC script. We add a separate CLI command that allows to batch apply repository configuration to one/a set/all repositories in a Gerrit site based on a provided configuration file.",

      "message": "I\u0027ve never like the idea that you have to apply a configuration to a repo just to be able to gc it. Perhaps that is an outdated method of doing things. All git commands seem to support using [-c \u003cname\u003e\u003d\u003cvalue\u003e], so why are we setting values in the repos directly. If we want to additionally set values in the repo, that can be done, but it seems this shouldn\u0027t be required just to run gc.",
