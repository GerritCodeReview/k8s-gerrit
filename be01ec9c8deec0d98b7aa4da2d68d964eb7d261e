      "message": "In theory, yes.\nWe could mount an NFS share to $SITE/etc. Then symlink all config files into the volume from the configmaps and secrets.\nI would prefer not to do that, because it further binds us to a shared filesystem and that for files that are basically used in read-only mode. Kubernetes Secrets are the resources meant to be used for something like that. This also has an advantage: The host keys can be managed in Vault and can with thus be easily rotated if required.\n\nTo decrease the entry barriers, I could adapt this change to only delete the generated host keys, if at leas tone has been provided via a secret.",
